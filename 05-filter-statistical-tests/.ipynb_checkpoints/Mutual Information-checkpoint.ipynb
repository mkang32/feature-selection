    "# Mutual Information\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutual Information (MI) is a measure of the mutual dependence between the two variables. It quantifies the \"amount of information\" obtained about on random variable through observing the other random variable. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information) \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ I(X;Y) = H(X)-H(X|Y) = \\sum_{x \\in X}\\sum_{y \\in Y} P(x, y) \\log(\\frac{P(x,y)}{P(x) P(y)}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where, \n",
    "* $I$ is the mutual information \n",
    "* $P(X, Y)$ is the probability of X and Y occuring together \n",
    "* $P(X)$ is the probability of X\n",
    "* $P(Y)$ is the probability of Y\n",
    "\n",
    "It determines how similar the joint distribution $P(X, Y)$ to the products of individual distributions $P(X)$ and $P(Y)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "If X and Y are independent, $P(X, Y)=P(X)P(Y)$, which makes the $\\log(\\frac{P_{(X, Y)}(x,y)}{P_X(x) P_Y(y)})=\\log(1) = 0$, and the entire equation becomes zero. Therefore, **If X and Y are independent, mutual information is zero.**\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if X is deterministic of Y, meaning by knowing X we can estimate Y, the mutual information is the uncertainty in X. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us suppose we have a join distribution table like below: \n",

    "X=1      | 0   | 0.2 | 0.1 | 0.3\n",
    "X=2      | 0.1 | 0   | 0.1 | 0.2\n",
    "Marginals| 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.4 | 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The mutual information between X and Y is; \n",
